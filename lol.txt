After touring in excess, the group reconvened at Jelly Boy Studios and spent
close to twelve months assembling their follow-up. During this time, 
Compston and Kenazi battled with health issues which ultimately delayed the
process, but returned with "SB's Truck" on 5 May 2016 - the first glimpse 
of new material ahead of upcoming EP Tunnel Vision On Your Part. Another 
single followed, "Anna, Lisa Calls", during which time the group toured 
Europe with The Dandy Warhols, eventually celebrating the release with a 
one-off headline show at Vauxhall City Farm.
